## Introduction 
Hi, i will start by explaining what this program does and what it is and how it works. 

So what he can do? 
He makes the life easier for Dragon Mania players that don't have much time to spend on the game and dont want to lose their progress. Or for people that dont want to make all the boring things. And the best part is that you dont need to stay at the PC a lot of time to do this things, this bot does them for you. Example: This bot can pet all the dragons in all habitats that you have, this saves you around 10 minutes if you have 11 habitats.

What it is and how it works?
So as i said he is a bot, but i must tell you that he cant see what is in the screen so somatimes can be hard to make things work, and i am doing the best that i can. To complete all this tasks he just do the same things that a person would do, he uses Keyboard inputs, Mouse clics inputs and he can ear the sounds that the game produces ( this is very important to understand i will explain this later). But i say again he cant see so dont expect it to do crazy things.
